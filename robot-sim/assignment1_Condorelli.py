Assignment 1 Research Track 1 - Valentina Condorelli S4945679

The first assignment of RT1 consists of making the robot compute the following steps: 
	- 1) find and grab the closest golden marker (token)
	- 2) move the marker to the center of the Arena marker
	- 3) find and grab the next closest golden marker (token)
	- 4) move the marker and release it near the marker found in step 2
	- 5) start again from 1 and repeat until all the golden markers are placed near each other (in this case, at the center of the Arena)

To run the program, type:
	$ python3 run.py assignment1_Condorelli.py
